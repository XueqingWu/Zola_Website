The goal of this project is to create ETL using Rust and query the SQLite database. Copilot is used to produce the Rust code.

### Functionality
1. Extract a dataset from a URL with CSV format.
2. Transform the data by cleaning, filtering, enriching, etc to get it ready for analysis.
3. Load the transformed data into a SQLite database table using Python's sqlite3 module with create and update operations.
4. Accept and execute general SQL queries including in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the SQLite database to analyze and retrieve insights from the data.
